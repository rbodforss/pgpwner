PGPwn.py is a PoC for a vulnerability in ABB Power generation information manager (PGIM) that is a data historian mainly used in ABB 800xA systems version 5.x.

The PoC exploits an authentication bypass and poor security architecture to reveal usernames and passwords in the system. Often these credentials are the same as for the control system, which leads to catastrophic consequences.

Please don't use my code for any offensive purpose. It should be used by authorized auditors to assess system security with permission from the system owner.

If you modify or reuse my code, please give credit to me.
